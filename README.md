# Guided Super-Resolution MSI Demo â€“ Python Shiny App
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Self-supervised **Guided Super-Resolution (GSR)** merges low-resolution mass-spectrometry ion maps with a co-registered high-resolution structural image (e.g. fluorescence or immunohistochemistry) to recover single-cell molecular detail.  
This Shiny for Python app provides an interactive front-end to a dual-encoder U-Net implementation of GSR, allowing you to upload your own images, tune hyper-parameters, and visualize results in real time.

## âœ¨ Key Features
* **Drag-and-drop UI** â€“ Upload a high-res guide image and a low-res MSI channel directly in the browser.  
* **Self-supervised training** â€“ Combines MSE and SSIM losses; no paired ground truth is required.  
* **Deterministic results** â€“ Uses the project-wide seed **6740** for reproducibility.  
* **GPU-optional** â€“ Runs on CPU by default; automatically switches to CUDA if available.  
* **Progress bar & live previews** â€“ Monitor training and instantly compare guide, input, and super-resolved output (with a perceptual *viridis* palette).
